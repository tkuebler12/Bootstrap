# Bootstrap
Repo for Bootstrap assignment week 2

Using Bootstrap to create websites is fast and efficient due to the fact that templates are already created and only need to be copied and pasted into an html file. This saves lots of time since not every tag has to be typed out. Bootstrap is also useful because features can be added with minimal changes to the rest of the code.
